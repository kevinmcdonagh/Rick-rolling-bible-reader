    <string name="para1">How can this be? Nicodemus asked. 10 You are Israels teacher, said Jesus, and do you not understand these things? 11 Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven  the Son of Man. 14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up 15 That everyone who believes may have eternal life in him. 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of Gods one and only Son. </string>
